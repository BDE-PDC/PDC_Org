# After 42

After 42, you can either :

- look for a job or an internship,
- take further training,
- start an entrepreneurial project.

Here are several ways to get your foot in the door, depending on what you choose.

## Entrepreneurship

- http://www.1819.be is the website gathering all the help (advice, subsidies, ...) for self-employed and entrepreneurs. Information is power.
- Training (free, six weeks) to learn how to launch a startup, be coached and find investors, in the same building as 42! http://bestarter.org
- Smart ASBL: not bad to test a freelance career and you don't have many clients, via an employee status. http://smartbe.be/fr/a-propos/ The smart ASBL does your accounting and chases your clients (so no late payments). They deduct taxes at source + their commission.
- http://www.youthstart.be/ - Youthstart provides entrepreneurship training to young people between 18 and 30 years old.
- www.jobframe.co - This new service facilitates the recruitment of unpaid students as freelancers (new legal framework since 2017)
- Job Yourself: http://jyb.be - Have a project? Need to think about it, to build it? Six months maximum of support for your project.
- https://www.ing.be/fr/business/my-business#starters - Otherwise ING has also launched a program to help beginners in entrepreneurship and set up tools with accompaniment until financing if the project is well.
