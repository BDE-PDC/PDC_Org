# Discussion on rates/salaries:

## Questions
— How do I know how much I will earn as an employee?
— How do I negotiate my contract/salary?
— As a freelancer, how much to ask for the realization of a website?

## The information collected
There is no real standard. Many factors come into play.

Before anything else, in a salary negotiation as in the calculation of its price, the most important question to ask is: **how much do I need (rent + bills + kids + entertainment + …)**.

During a job interview, what is being sold are skills and qualities.
Be careful not to forget that this is a mutual evaluation. It is not about begging, but about assessing whether collaboration would be interesting for both parties.

### Employee:
Minimum salary for a junior web dev: 1350€ net/month

— Negotiate the whole contract, not just the salary
— Take into account the possible extra-legal benefits (insurance, meal vouchers, telephone, company car, …), overtime, weekend work, …
— Always negotiate the gross salary (because the net salary depends on the situation of each person)
— When you arrive on the job market, you tend to take what is offered without negotiating too much → if this is the case, at least ask to negotiate a salary increase after 6 months for example
— Possibility of salary simulation (unions, web, …)

### Freelance:
Very variable.
Average/minimum rate for an ultra-basic site: ±1200 €.

Increases with the complexity of the project (backend, design, training, …) and can easily reach 5.000€, 10.000€,… (an ultra badass site + VIP package at 80.000€ has been mentioned)

— Several possibilities: hourly rate, subscription system, packages, …
— When establishing the estimate, take into account the time that will be spent on decision-making, telephone interviews, etc.
— Keep in mind that the time needed will decrease with the experience and knowledge acquired (→ progressive increase of the hourly rate)
— If fixed price, rather according to the technologies (ex: WordPress is much “faster” than creating a multi-language site, etc.)
— In general, you have to be bold enough, not to be afraid to ask for an essential amount, because the risk is not to be taken seriously if not too demanding.
— Do not forget that his estimate of the rate according to the time and effort required is not always identical to the value given to the project by the client
