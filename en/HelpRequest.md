# How to get help?

At 42, as on the web, we help each other out, we have to! So we'd like to help you.
To improve your chances of getting an answer (on a forum like [stackoverflow.com],
 from a colleague, (https://stackoverflow.com), or as a last resort, from a deformer), here are some tips to follow before asking your question:

1. Make sure you have tried **everything** yourself first.
1. Describe your problem **precisely:**

- what is the error message?
- what did you want to do?
- what was supposed to happen?
- what happened?
- what is the URL of the error?
- what solutions did you try?
- what did you look for on the internet?

2. **Show your code**, exactly where you are blocking. Isolate the problem using tools like
- [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/) (HTML, CSS, JS problem)
- [sqlfiddle.com](http://sqlfiddle.com)(DB problems)
- [phpio.net](http://phpio.net/) (PHP problems)
- ...

This helps us to reproduce the problem.

3. While including this information, be aware that you are talking to an already busy person and be **concise** in your question.
